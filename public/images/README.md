# CYOA Illustration Images

This directory should contain the following image files used in the Journey Under the Sea adventure:

- `JOURNEY_UNDER_THE_SEA.webp` - The main illustration showing a submersible exploring an underwater cavern
- Other illustrations for various scenes in the adventure

These images will be displayed in the book pages throughout the interactive experience. For development purposes, you can use placeholder images, but for production, these should be high-quality illustrations matching the CYOA book style.
