Paper Texture for CYOA Book

For the realistic book appearance, you need to add a paper texture image file named 'paper-texture.png' to this directory.

Characteristics of a good paper texture:
- Subtle off-white or cream color
- Light grain pattern
- Very slight noise or paper fiber appearance
- No strong patterns or visible watermarks
- 500-1000px square size (will be repeated as a pattern)

The paper texture should be subtle enough to not distract from the content while providing an authentic book paper appearance.

You can find suitable paper textures on sites like:
- Unsplash
- Freepik
- Pexels
- Texture libraries

After adding the texture image, the book pages will have a more authentic appearance.
