      <Heading>THE BEGINNING OF YOUR ADVENTURE</Heading>
      <TextBlock>
        You open your eyes to find yourself standing at a crossroads. The path ahead splits into three directions: a dark forest to the left, a mountain trail straight ahead, and a coastal road to the right.

      <TextBlock>
        The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the landscape. You have only a few hours of daylight left, and you need to make a decision quickly. Each path offers its own challenges and mysteries.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        You check your backpack: a map (though it doesn't show where these paths lead), a water bottle, some trail mix, and a small flashlight. Not much, but it will have to do.

      <Heading>THE DARK FOREST</Heading>
      <TextBlock>
        As you step onto the forest path, the temperature drops noticeably. Tall trees create a dense canopy overhead, filtering the sunlight into eerie, dappled patterns on the ground. The forest is alive with sounds â€“ birds calling, leaves rustling, and occasionally, something larger moving in the underbrush.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        The path winds deeper into the woods, becoming narrower and less defined with each step. After walking for about twenty minutes, you come to a fork in the trail. To the left, the path descends into a misty hollow. To the right, it climbs upward, becoming steeper but offering glimpses of light breaking through the trees.

    <div key="page4">
      <Heading>THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL</Heading>
      <TextBlock>
        The mountain trail is rocky but well-marked. As you begin your ascent, the air becomes cooler and clearer. Below you, the landscape unfolds in a breathtaking panorama of forests and fields. The climb is challenging, but exhilarating.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        After an hour of steady hiking, you reach a plateau. Here, the trail divides. One path continues upward toward the summit, while another skirts around the side of the mountain, leading to what appears to be a cave entrance in the distance.

    <div key="page5">
      <Heading>THE COASTAL ROAD</Heading>
      <TextBlock>
        The coastal road offers a stunning view of the ocean. Waves crash against the rocks below as seabirds wheel overhead. The salty breeze is refreshing, and you feel your spirits lift as you walk along the clifftop path.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        After following the road for about two miles, you come to a small fishing village nestled in a protected cove. The village appears quiet, almost deserted, but smoke rises from a few chimneys. At the harbor, a single boat is docked, gently rocking in the water.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        You can explore the village, or approach the boat and its weathered captain, who seems to be making repairs to the sail.

        This is just a demonstration of the page-turning animation functionality. In a complete implementation, we would have many more pages with a full branching narrative structure.
      </TextBlock>
      <TextBlock>
        The AnimatedBook component can handle as many pages as needed, with realistic 3D page turning effects and proper state management.
