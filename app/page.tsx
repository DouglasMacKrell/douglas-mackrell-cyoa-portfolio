            The cable attaching you to the <em>Maray</em> is extended to its limit. You have come to rest on a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that ancient myth says leads to the lost city of Atlantis.

The new suit contains a number of the latest microprocessors enabling a variety of useful functions. It even has a built-in PDA with laser communicator. You can cut loose from the cable; the <em>Seeker</em> is self-propelled. You are now in another world. Remember, this is a dangerous world, an unknown world.

            Carefully maneuvering the <em>Seeker</em> between the walls of the canyon, you discover a large round hole. A stream of large bubbles flows steadily out of the hole. The <em>Seeker</em> is equipped with scientific equipment to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equipment that can measure depth. The ocean covers close to 90% of the earth and is mostly unknown. Who knows where this hole might lead?

            The AI-32 is an intelligent computer unlike any other machine before it. For that reason there is no need to learn "how to work it." The computer will teach you how to use it itself. Just flick on the power switch. When the amber light comes on, press the button marked INSTRUCTION MODE. Then introduce yourself in an ordinary conversational voice. Your computer will answer back.

            Since your AI-32 (Conrad) has not been preprogrammed with information about you, start off by telling it about yourself. Your name, school, and age, who's in your family, and what your hobbies and sports are. Once your computer has gotten to know you, it will be much more useful to you. You'll find your AI-32 will be a really good friend!

            You decide to explore the ledge where the <em>Seeker</em> has come to rest. You carefully climb out of the small submarine and stand on the ocean floor. Your special diving suit is working perfectly, protecting you from the crushing pressure of the deep. The powerful lamp on your helmet illuminates the area around you.

            The ledge extends about 100 feet to your right and then drops off into the deeper canyon. The rock is covered with colorful sea anemones and strange deep-sea creatures you've never seen before. As you move forward, you notice what appears to be a carved stone archway half-buried in the sediment. This is no natural formation!

            You approach the stone archway with caution. As you clear away some of the sediment, you reveal intricate carvings unlike any known civilization. The symbols don't match any ancient writing system you've studied - not Egyptian, not Sumerian, not even the mysterious Rongorongo script of Easter Island.
