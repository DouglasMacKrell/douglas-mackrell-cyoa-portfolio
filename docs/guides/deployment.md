# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

This document outlines the process for deploying the CYOA Portfolio project to production environments.

## Deployment Platforms

The application is designed to be deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), the platform created by the team behind Next.js. This provides optimal performance and features for Next.js applications.

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, ensure:

1. All tests pass: `npm test`
2. The build succeeds locally: `npm run build`
3. Changes have been merged to the appropriate branch (`main` for production)
4. All environment variables are configured correctly

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be configured in your deployment environment:

```
# No sensitive environment variables currently required
```

## Deployment Process

### Deploying to Vercel

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel**
   - Create an account on Vercel
   - Import your GitHub project
   - Configure the build settings:
     - Framework Preset: Next.js
     - Build Command: `npm run build`
     - Output Directory: `.next`

2. **Configure environment variables**
   - Add any required environment variables in the Vercel project settings

3. **Deploy**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy when changes are pushed to the `main` branch
   - You can also trigger manual deployments from the Vercel dashboard

### Manual Deployment

If you're not using Vercel, you can deploy to any platform that supports Node.js:

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the production server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will run on port 3000 by default, but this can be configured using the `PORT` environment variable.

## Deployment Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- Application performance
- Error logs
- User feedback

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are discovered in production:

1. Revert to the previous version by redeploying the previous build
2. If using Vercel, you can rollback to a previous deployment from the dashboard
3. Address the issues in a new branch and follow the standard deployment process

## Deployment Checklist

Before each production deployment, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] The application builds successfully
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are acceptable
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met
- [ ] Browser compatibility is verified

## Custom Domain Configuration

To use a custom domain with the deployment:

1. Configure DNS settings for your domain, adding CNAME records pointing to your deployment provider
2. Configure your custom domain in your deployment platform settings
3. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 24-48 hours)

## CI/CD Pipeline

For continuous integration and deployment:

1. GitHub Actions or a similar CI/CD service can be configured
2. Tests should run automatically on every push
3. Deployment should trigger automatically when merging to the main branch
4. Consider setting up preview deployments for pull requests

## Performance Optimization

For optimal performance in production:

- Enable caching where appropriate
- Optimize image sizes
- Use Next.js's built-in Image component for automatic optimization
- Configure Content Delivery Network (CDN) if available

## Security Considerations

- Keep dependencies updated
- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities with `npm audit`
- Follow security best practices for your deployment platform
