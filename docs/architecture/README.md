# 🏗️ Architecture Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation about the CYOA Portfolio project's architecture, organization, and design decisions.

## Overview Documents

- [**Project Overview**](./project-overview.md) - High-level overview of the system design and architecture
- [**Data Flow**](./data-flow.md) - How data moves through the application (*future*)
- [**State Management**](./state-management.md) - How state is handled across the application (*future*)
- [**Performance Considerations**](./performance.md) - Techniques used to ensure optimal performance (*future*)

## Technical Decisions

- [**Styling Strategy**](./styling-strategy.md) - Details on the hybrid Styled Components/Tailwind approach (*future*)
- [**Routing Structure**](./routing-structure.md) - Next.js App Router implementation details (*future*)
- [**Testing Architecture**](./testing-architecture.md) - How tests are organized and implemented (*future*)
- [**Accessibility Implementation**](./accessibility.md) - How accessibility features are implemented (*future*)

## Directory Structure

The application follows this general directory structure:

```
/
├── app/                # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/         # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                # Utility functions and shared logic
├── public/             # Static assets
├── docs/               # Documentation
├── __tests__/          # Test files
└── .cursor/            # Cursor rules and configuration
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - UI is broken down into reusable, composable components
   - Each component has a single responsibility
   - Components are designed to be testable in isolation

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - UI logic is separated from application logic
   - Styling is separated from component structure
   - Data fetching is separated from data display

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core functionality works without JavaScript
   - Enhanced features are added for modern browsers
   - Accessibility is a baseline requirement

4. **Code Organization**
   - Related code is grouped together
   - Files are kept under 500 lines
   - Common patterns are extracted into utilities

5. **Performance First**
   - Code splitting for reduced bundle size
   - Optimized asset loading
   - Careful management of re-renders

## Architectural Decision Records

Future architectural decisions should be documented here to maintain a history of why certain choices were made.
